#using Talaris2013, and my checked out branch of Per's pgreisen/griddesign
#  will not run on current master of Rosetta, make sure pgreisen/griddesign checked out!
#testing SecondaryStructureDensity to optimize SS content and SS contacts with ligand
#  will apply to hits that already passed sasa and orientation filters (so removing those from this protocol)
#  This version has no design (only the SecondaryStructureDensity filter)
