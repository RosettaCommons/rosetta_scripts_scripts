This is an extremely basic homology modeling script.  It takes one pre-threaded
input `2BMX_threaded.pdb` which is the `2BMXA.pdb` has been threaded with the `1XVQ.fasta`
sequence in accordance to the the `1XVQ_2BMX.grishin` alignment file. It assumes that there
are some constraints that you would like to satisfy, such as crosslinking results.  In this
case we use a very simple constraint between two lysines. Note the `keep_pose_constraint`
flag. Note that the constraint weight is something that you will have to play around 
with when you run your experiments. This script is run with the command:
$ROSETTA/source/bin/rosetta_scripts @hybridize.flags
