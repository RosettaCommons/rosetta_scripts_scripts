The input file was generated by relaxing the receptor (RasGRP1, PDB ID: 4L9M) and scaffold (HaloTag, PDB ID: 5Y2Y) separately, then concatenating them together to create input_HaloTag_RasGRP1_relaxed.pdb. The scaffold should be placed on the same side of the receptor as the targeted interface, with some empty space between the two.
