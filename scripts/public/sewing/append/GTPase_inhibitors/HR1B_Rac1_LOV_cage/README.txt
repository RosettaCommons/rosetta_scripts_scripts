This script sets up a SEWING run to append onto the C terminus of an asLov2 j-alpha/PKN HR1B fusion to make photoactivatable Rac1 inhibitors. It sets up a 10,000 cycle run with default simulated annealing metrics; it also specifies that only the C terminus should be built upon, and further specifies that residue 65 of the starting structure should not be overwritten; as required resnums are treated as a continuous block, it is only necessary to specify the [modifiable terminus]-most vital residue.
